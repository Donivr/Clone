Creating new github repository

Step1: go to github.com  -> select create new repository 
will create new repository 

step2: 
select the url either https or ssh key

if you select https option: url would be: git clone https://gihub.com/username/repository/.git

if you select ssh option: url would be: git clone git@github.com:/username/repository/.git


got to cloud terminal:

create new directory and git clone command.
update the code and git push

If it is in GitHub windows:
download the githubdesktop client and install it.

once you install the github then clone the github repository and github data will come to your
local machine
update the files you would like it and commit the code and make pull request which is at 
right top corner

once you pull the request, your request will go to other team member and he will merge the 
request after that your changes will be in the github repository.

port number:
http:80
https:443
ssh:22

Creating key using ssh-keygen:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
then it will create a two keys under /username/.ssh/id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files 

id_rsa is private file and is_rsa.pub is public file you will copy the content of this file
in github repository settings which is in top right corner.
once you are in settings then go to ssh keys and add ssh key, give some name and copy the content
from the id_rsa and paste it here.

now you go to the terminal if you git clone it will allow you to clone the project using your
credentials.
